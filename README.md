# ASCII Art Generator (Pure Python)

This project generates ASCII art using **pure Python logic** without using any external libraries.

## 📌 Project Description
The ASCII art is created using nested `for` loops and `if-elif` conditional statements.
Each character is decided manually based on row and column positions and written
to a text file using Python file handling.

This project follows all given constraints and does not use any image processing.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Core Python only)
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`)
